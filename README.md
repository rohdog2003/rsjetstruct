rsjetstruct is a python module for calculating the spectra of gamma ray burst afterglow reverse shocks for a structured jet model devised by Zhang, Wang, and Zheng 2024. Spectral shapes are calculated using Granot and Sari 2002.

LaskarFigure11.py is a demo which employs weighted least square fits (on GRB 221009A radio data from Laskar et al. 2023) using this module.
